## ✨ Learn Python's Libraries/Module/Packages ✨

1. **Built-in standard libraries** :
   Ex. random, csv, math, datetime, os, sys, json,...
2. **Other external Useful libraries** :
   Ex. Pillow (PIL), Requests, Pandas, NumPy, ...

### Built-in standard libraries :

- Included with Python by default

1. **_csv_**:

   > Resources:

   1. [CSV Module in Python (basics + advance)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/csv-module-python-manish-v--ojyhe)
   2. [Python’s documentation of CSV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)

2. **_math_**: https://realpython.com/python-math-module/#getting-to-know-the-python-math-module

   > Resources:

   1. [The Python math Module: Everything You Need to Know](https://realpython.com/python-math-module/#getting-to-know-the-python-math-module)
   2. [Python’s documentation of math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)

---

### External libraries :

- Requires separate installation using tools like pip (pip install library_name).

1.  pytest:

    - learning Pillow can be worthwhile for web development: 1. Image Processing Tasks - such as resizing, cropping, rotating, filtering, and more. 2. Format Conversion, 3. Thumbnail Generation, 4. Watermarking, 5. Dynamic Image Generation-
    - Installation: `pip install pytest`

    > Resources:

2.  pillow (PIL):

    - learning Pillow can be worthwhile for web development: 1. Image Processing Tasks - such as resizing, cropping, rotating, filtering, and more. 2. Format Conversion, 3. Thumbnail Generation, 4. Watermarking, 5. Dynamic Image Generation-
    - Installation: `pip install Pillow` or `pip3 install Pillow`
